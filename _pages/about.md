I am a third-year master's student specializing in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) with a focus on large-scale bridge infrastructure. My research centers on the development of advanced techniques for the identification and classification of special events and anomalies within bridge monitoring data. By leveraging cutting-edge methodologies, my work aims to improve the safety and longevity of critical infrastructure. My research contributes to the field of civil engineering by addressing key challenges in the real-time assessment and maintenance of structural integrity, ensuring the continued reliability of essential transportation networks.
