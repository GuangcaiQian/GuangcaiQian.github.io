I am a third-year master's student specializing in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) with a focus on large-scale bridge infrastructure. My research centers on the development of advanced techniques for the identification and classification of special events and anomalies within bridge monitoring data. By leveraging cutting-edge methodologies, my work aims to improve the safety and longevity of critical infrastructure. 


My research contributes to the field of civil engineering by addressing key challenges in the real-time assessment and maintenance of structural integrity, ensuring the continued reliability of essential transportation networks.


I graduated from KUST and studied under Prof. [Wei Xu](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-5958-9288). I completed my studies under the guidance of Lecturer [Zhiyi Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cgAplYkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra)
